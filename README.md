## 📌 Project Overview

The **School Management System** is a relational database project built using **MySQL** to manage academic and administrative activities of a school.
It efficiently stores and organizes data related to **students, teachers, classes, subjects, attendance, exams, marks, fees, parents, departments, and timetables** while maintaining strong data integrity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design a **normalized database (up to 3NF)**
* Implement **15 interrelated tables**
* Enforce **PRIMARY KEY & FOREIGN KEY constraints**
* Support **real-world school operations**
* Enable **complex JOIN queries for reports**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Tool:** MySQL Workbench
* **Query Language:** SQL

---

## 🗂️ Database Tables (15)

1. Students
2. Teachers
3. Classes
4. Subjects
5. Teacher_Subject
6. Attendance
7. Exams
8. Marks
9. Fees
10. Fee_Payments
11. Parents
12. Student_Parent
13. Timetable
14. Departments
15. Teacher_Department

Each table is designed with:

* Proper data types
* Primary keys
* Foreign key relationships

---

## 🧩 Database Features

* Fully **normalized structure**
* One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships
* Data consistency using constraints
* Supports reporting using **JOIN, GROUP BY, WHERE, HAVING**
* Scalable for real school systems
